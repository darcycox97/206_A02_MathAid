# GUI-MathsAid
<p>A fairly simple GUI application that is used to manage "creations". 
You may use create mode to create new creations, or you may play and delete existing creations</p>

<p>A "creation" is a video with some text over it that has an audio track recorded by you.</p> 

<p>To run this program, simply download the provided MathsAid.jar file into a blank directory (the app creates its own subfolders within the directory it is launched from) and run it from the command line using "java -jar MathsAid.jar".</p>
